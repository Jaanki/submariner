# This is a temporary workflow added to test support for VxLAN driver
# while its being developed. This workflow will run only on PRs with label
# 'vxlan'. Once https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner/pull/1171 is
# merged, this workflow will be removed and VxLAN cable driver testing
# will be moved to e2e.yml.
